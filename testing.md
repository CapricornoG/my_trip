## Testing
> Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.
### Overview

Due to time constraints, comprehensive testing for the Travel Journal project has not been fully completed. Key functionalities were manually tested to ensure that the core features of the application operate as intended. A complete testing plan, including validation and automated testing, is outlined below and will be implemented in the near future.

### Manual Testing

The following functionalities were manually tested and confirmed to be working as expected:

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register and log in with valid credentials.
- **Journal Entry Creation**: Users can create, view, and manage their travel journal entries.
- **Responsive Design**: The application layout adjusts appropriately on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

### Known Issues

- **HTML and CSS Validation**: Validation checks have not been fully completed. Some HTML files contain Jinja syntax that needs adjustment for validation.
- **JavaScript Testing**: Automated testing for JavaScript functionality is pending. Manual checks confirmed basic functionality without detailed test coverage.
- **Accessibility**: A full accessibility review is pending, with plans to ensure WCAG compliance.

### Next Steps

To ensure comprehensive testing and validation, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Complete HTML and CSS Validation**: Adjust Jinja templates to meet W3C standards and validate all HTML and CSS files.
2. **Implement Automated Testing**:
   - Use a framework like Selenium or Cypress for end-to-end testing of the user interface.
   - Utilize JSHint or ESLint for JavaScript linting and error detection.
3. **Accessibility Checks**:
   - Use tools like WAVE or Axe to ensure the site meets accessibility standards.
4. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test the application across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent user experience.

### Conclusion

While core functionalities have been tested manually, the full testing process will be prioritized and completed as soon as possible. This will include automated tests, validation checks, and accessibility improvements to enhance the overall quality and reliability of the application.
